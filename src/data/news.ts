Big Talents has written its name into T-Esports Championship history with a runner-up finish at **T-Esports Championship Season 2** in Budapest.

## Our first LAN grand final as Big Talents

Across the online phase and LAN finals in Budapest, our Brawl Stars roster fought through one of the most stacked fields of the season. The campaign ended on November 16 with Big Talents reaching the grand final before falling to **Ninjago** in a best-of-five series.

This result secures **second place overall at an A-tier international event** and marks the first time the BGT banner has stood on stage in a major offline final.

## The roster behind the run

Our TEC Season 2 line-up:

- **Arthur** – mechanical anchor and lane specialist  
- **Salty** – veteran EMEA competitor with deep BSC experience  
- **Trashie** – aggressive playmaker and space creator  
- **Soleil (Coach)** – French coach leading macro, drafts and preparation  

Together, this group delivered clutch sets on stage and proved they can consistently compete with the very best in EMEA.

## Moments from Budapest

A few snapshots from our first LAN grand final as Big Talents:

## Why this result matters

T-Esports Championship Season 2 brought together top line-ups from across the region to fight for a significant prize pool and international visibility. Finishing second:

- validates the long-term roster project we’ve been building around Arthur, Salty and Trashie  
- gives BGT crucial LAN experience heading into future Brawl Stars Championship seasons  
- shows future partners and players that Big Talents can deliver **results**, not just vibes  

## Looking ahead

This is not the destination. It is the new baseline. The goals from here are clear:

- return to future championships as **title contenders**  
- qualify consistently for Brawl Stars Championship Monthly Finals  
- convert finals appearances into **trophies**  

To everyone who supported us in the arena, online and in the club: thank you.  
The next time you see Big Talents on a LAN stage, the mission is simple: we want to be the ones lifting the trophy.

The **BGT Creator Program** is live.

For a long time, Big Talents has been building tournaments, clubs and community projects around Brawl Stars. The Creator Program is the next step: a structured way to support the people who put the game on screen every day.

Whether you stream on Twitch, upload to YouTube, grind TikTok, or do a bit of everything, BGT is opening a long-term home for creators who want to grow with an esports org instead of just sitting under a logo.

## Three paths: Academy, Partnered, Elite

The program is built around three tiers, each with different expectations and support levels:

- **Academy Creators** – rising talents who are starting to build consistent content and want guidance, promotion and a real network.  
- **Partnered Creators** – established channels with stable viewership who want deeper collaboration, brand deals and regular features on bigtalents.org.  
- **Elite Creators** – flagship faces of BGT, tightly integrated into our esports projects, campaigns and live events.  

Across every tier, the philosophy is the same: **we help you grow, you stay independent, and we build something bigger together.**

## Perks & support

Highlights of the BGT Creator Program include:

- Creator spotlights and dedicated profile pages on **/rosters/creators**  
- Priority access to sponsored events, showmatches and activations around our teams and projects  
- Graphic and branding support for thumbnails, overlays and social media identity  
- Internal feedback channels with BGT staff, players and other creators  
- Early information about future projects, LAN appearances and collaborations  

As the program matures, we will expand it with additional revenue-share opportunities around sponsorships and campaigns connected to BGT projects.

## How to apply

You can read the full details, requirements and benefits and submit an application on the **/creator-program** page.

We review applications in waves and reach out directly on Discord if there is a fit. If you do not hear back immediately, it just means we are still processing the queue, not that you should stop creating.

If you are a Brawl Stars creator who feels aligned with how BGT operates, this is your signal.  
Build **with** us, not just next to us.
